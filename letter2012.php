<h1>Invitation To MITMUNC 2012</h1>

<p>Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisers,</p>
<br />
<p>It gives me great pleasure to invite you to the fourth annual Massachusetts Institute of Technology Model United Nations Conference (MITMUNC) on February 10-12, 2012.</p>
<p>MITMUNC is a young, unique, and innovative high school Model United Nations conference, focusing on committees that have a scientific and/or technological foundation.  The high school students attending do not have to be science experts - rather, our goal is to have our chairs use their expertise in areas relating to their committees' topics to make scientific issues accessible to the students, so that the students can learn debating and public speaking skills alongside with understanding the scientific basis behind their arguments.  Last year, our committees included the UNSC chaired by a computer science major and a mathematic major discussing "Cyber Security" and "Bioterrorism", as well as the WHO, chaired by a biology major.  Small committee sizes and knowledgeable chairs across the board will encourage every student to get involved in the process.  MIT has long championed the intersection of academic knowledge and practical skills, and we hope to bring that same spirit to our conference.</p>
<p>Last year's conference was a huge success.  Debate ranged from finding a solution for the question of Darfur to fighting for rights of indigenous people across the world, as top-notch students challenged one another's positions and considered the ramifications of their joint actions. Working papers turned into resolutions, as everyone strove for complete solutions to the complex problems their committees were facing.</p>
<p>Now that this will be the fourth year of the conference, our MITMUNC staff will be more experienced than ever before.  Many of our Secretariat members and chairs have Model United Nations experience on the high school and college levels from both chairing and being a delegate themselves at many conferences.  We're also very excited about the flexibility that comes with a new conference and can't wait for you to see what we have in store.</p>  
<p>Early Registration for the conference will be opened on August 8, 2011 and the deadline for that is October 15, 2011.  The deadline for Regular Registration is December 15, 2011.  Late registrations will be accepted through January 15, 2012.  You can register your delegation and view more information by visiting <a href="http://www.mitmunc.org/">http://www.mitmunc.org/</a>.

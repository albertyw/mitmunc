<h3>Media Reporting of Terrorism</h3>
<p>This topic boils down to this dichotomy: freedom of speech versus the concept "more ink equals more blood". While some believe speech should not be limited by the government, others feel that media publishing governmental tactics and secrets should be considered treasonous. The debate is still alive today; just look at the WikiLeaks scandal. Moreover, it has also appeared in situations involving terrorist groups utilizing the media to express their views and fear. For example, Bin Laden used video and other forms of communication to promote his ideals to viewers and to maintain a powerful global image. Not only can the media express terrorism, but it can also allow terrorists to learn about government secrets that need to be kept secrets for national security purposes. Countries are free to find other examples of media reporting of terrorism, and the background guide will present more details on this topic.</p>
<h3>Responsibility to Protect</h3>
<p>The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a doctrine that came out as a result of the UN 2005 World Summit and it is a commitment that all states will step up to prevent a genocide like the one in Rwanda. It purports 3 basic points:<br />
<ol>
    <li>The State carries the primary responsibility for the protection of populations from genocide, war, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing.</li>
    <li>The international community has a responsibility to assist States in fulfilling this responsibility.</li>
    <li>The international community should use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian, and other peaceful means to protect populations from these crimes. If a State fails to protect its populations or is in fact the perpetrator of crimes, the international community must be prepared to take stronger measures--including the collective use of force through the UN Security Council.</li>
</ol>
This has been mostly relevant with a few recent conflicts--for example, Libya which is a definite R2P issue. Some instances have even had the potential to be R2P issues--such as Egypt and Iran. The big debates involved in this topic sometimes boil down to whether the R2P violates a State's sovereignty. What issues (apart from genocide and ethnic cleansing) should be included in R2P? Should there be more than just a doctrine, or maybe a treaty among the member States of the UN?

<h3>Promoting the use of DNA Genetics in Protecting Human Rights</h3>
<p>Advances in the field of genetics, especially with the sequencing of the human genome, have led to numerous applications and promising further research. Genetic data are useful for disease prevention, medical diagnosis, and medical treatments. Genetic analysis can also be used as a means of identification by forensic scientists, most notably in criminal justice systems. This has led to the creation of genetic databanks containing samples from millions of people. Due to this rapid rise of interest in the field of genetics, concerns have surfaced about the potential for the use human genetic data in applications that conflict with basic human rights and freedoms. There is thus a pressing need for international guidelines addressing this critical bioethical issue: the use of DNA genetics in protecting human rights.</p>
<h3>The Prevention of Illegal Organ Trading in Disaaster Affected Areas</h3>
<p>Organ trade is essentially the trade involving human organs for transplantation. Possibly as a result of regulations on the worldwide trade of organs, there is a shortage of organs available for transplantation. The demand for human organs has grown due to increased lifespans, more accurate medical diagnoses of organ failure cases, and improved success rate of organ transplants. Trafficking in human tissue is thus a major issue, as the world’s poorest person can earn an average of $5,000 for selling an organ. In disaster-affected areas, this is further exacerbated by the basic human need and desire to survive; the readiness of a person to sell their organs and their vulnerability to exploitation increase together. This year, the HRC will tackle the problem of developing a comprehensive framework to prevent these illegal transfers.</p>

<h3>An International Repository for Ultimate Storage of High Level Nuclear Waste</h3>
<p>Climate change concerns have created growing interest in low-carbon, alternative energy sources. Nuclear power has emerged as a carbon-free technology that is available for deployment to meet baseload energy demand. More than 50 countries have approached the IAEA and expressed interest in setting up nuclear power programs. 433 power reactors are in operation, 65 more are under construction, and several others are likely to be deployed over the next decade. However, the question of ultimate disposal of nuclear waste remains to be answered in most member states. Sweden has sited a repository and begun construction, and USA and France are moving towards siting long-term repositories for ultimate disposal of High Level Waste (HLW). Both China and India are expanding installed nuclear capacity but have not yet chosen a site or technology for an ultimate repository. In this committee the member states of the IAEA will discuss the possibility of constructing a single international repository or several such repositories for the ultimate storage of high-level waste produced in all the member states. The question of storing radioactive waste produced by nuclear reactors has been put off for several decades. In light of recent events in Japan, this question now needs to be resolved in order to improve the public acceptance of nuclear power and ensure its continued expansion.</p>
<br /><h3>The role of the IAEA in information exchange and knowledge transfer: striking a balance between transparency and confidentiality</h3><p>
	As a nonpartisan international organization that advocates using &quot;atoms for peace&quot;, the IAEA monitors the nuclear programs of its member states, and verifies through inspections their compliance with commitments and treaties--such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The IAEA then reports its findings to the United Nations.</p>

<p>
	Mindful of a rapidly changing energy and security landscape, this committee will seek to reevaluate the objectives and functions of the IAEA. There will be an emphasis on the cooperation of member states with the IAEA as well as with each other. The roles, rights, needs, and responsibilities of all parties will be discussed with a special emphasis on the improvement of cooperation, and the treatment and release of sensitive information. Toward this goal, this committee will consider the factors that define the IAEA&#39;s methods, roles, and responsibilities.</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, delegates will look at how &quot;transparent&quot; and cooperative member nations are in allowing inspections of nuclear facilities. Transparency in the dissemination of the information that the IAEA collects will also be discussed. There have been and continue to be issues regarding a lack of transparency, which leads to mistrust and tension. What can be done to solve this problem? How can transparency be encouraged and how should a lack of it be dealt with? As for the IAEA, how should it deal with the information it collects? It has a responsibility to the international community to keep it informed about volatile situations.</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, however, there is a certain degree of confidentiality between the IAEA and member states that must be upheld. The availability of information -- or lack thereof -- on the nuclear programs as well as the cooperativeness of Iran, North Korea, Israel, and Venezuela will be discussed in this context. Recent and upcoming events, particularly the debate regarding Iran (both its cooperativeness and information release standards), will play a key role in discussing the future of the IAEA and its policies.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Sudan</h3>
<p>The February 2011 referendum in which 99% of South Sudan's population expressed support for their secession from Sudan did little to ease the tensions that have been building up in the nation over the past half century. Already facing a humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region the now-split country faces a difficult path as the North and South adjust to a divided Sudan. The situation is perhaps as volatile now as ever with South Sudan attempting to build a nation independent from the North in a resource-rich but infrastructure-poor region. The two countries–represented by their respective ministries–and international players must attempt to prevent the situation from boiling over into chaos. When crises emerge as the result of their failures to forestall conflict, the three bodies must be ready to react quickly, decisively, and effectively. With Sudan's refugee crisis, disputed border, and fragile oil infrastructure, the Triumvirate must be prepared to address a wide variety of crises.</p>

<h3>Status of Women in Developing Countries</h3>
<p>
	Although the fight for gender equality was marked as one of the Millennium Development Goals, it has not yet&nbsp;been achieved in any country, according to statistical results. Nevertheless, it has been noted time and again that women empowerment benefits local economies, alleviates poverty, enhances democratic regimes, and improves many other areas of a State. Insufficient women inclusion is especially visible in developing countries. Some of the questions and topics that should be addressed in this debate are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		How can women empowerment contribute to solving specific problems?</li>
	<li>
		How can we more efficiently improve the inclusion of women?</li>
	<li>

		Short-term and long-term plans for empowering women in developing countries</li>
	<li>
		Contribution of developed countries to the fight for equal rights in developing countries</li>
	<li>
		Economic&nbsp;implications of women inclusion</li>
</ul>
<h3>Availability of Information and Communication Technologies in Developing Countries</h3>
<p>The Millennium Development Goals target 8F calls for the availability of new technologies--especially information and communication technologies--in developing countries. The use of information and communication technologies can be applied in the fields of socioeconomic development, international development, and human rights. This committee will seek to address the necessity of new technologies and determine their benefits and potential drawbacks. In addition, the committee will strive to come to a consensus on how the distribution of information and myriad communication technologies in developing countries can be best implemented.</p>

<h3>Biodiversity restoration for sustainable development food security and livelihoods</h3>
<p>	Present scientific understanding of ecosystem services is substantial and extremely relevant for policy purposes. Therefore, it merits urgent attention by decision-makers since current patterns of human activity are unsustainable and threaten to impair critical life-supporting functions. Failure to maintain biodiversity undermines economic prosperity, food security, and other aspects of human well-being. While the international community remains far from fully understanding the importance of the ecosystem services, the accelerating rate of disruption of a plethora of ecosystems and the biosphere makes imperative the incorporation of current knowledge into the policy making process. Thus, key questions and topics in this debate would be the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Is conservation of biodiversity important? Why so?</li>
	<li>
		The contribution of developed versus developing world in to conserving biodiversity</li>
	<li>
		Short-term plan to reduce the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems</li>
	<li>

		Long-term plan to revive biodiversity</li>
	<li>
		The economics of conservation</li>
	<li>
		Creation of accountability systems</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Reviewing and promoting the Kyoto Protocol with special reference to increasing the sustainability and efficiency of energy projects</h3>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol has generally been seen as an important first step towards a verily global emission-reduction plan that would stabilize GHG emissions, and would provide the essential architecture for any future international agreement on climate change. By the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a new international framework needs to have been negotiated and ratified that can deliver the stringent emission reductions indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A consensus must be developed on the new and improved methods for the reduction of greenhouse gases with special reference to how current and future energy projects align with the previous protocol&#39;s goals. This is to occur on both a small-scale arena within national communities and a large-scale arena in international structures. The current international economic status, the accelerating need for energy production in developing nations, and the sustainability management for future emission targets must all be taken into account. Some key questions and topics to consider are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Review the status of the current energy projects and adherence/ability to accurately measure emission levels</li>
	<li>
		Should there be a larger focus on sustainability projects in the future?</li>
	<li>
		How largely is the country committed to renewable initiatives? Have they changed their stance on the Kyoto Protocol since the Copenhagen conference?</li>
	<li>

		Reviewing the quotas of greenhouse emissions and possibilities of a carbon tax for large emissions or other adherence incentives</li>
	<li>
		Assessment of previous accountability methods</li>
	<li>
		Small scale energy projects within national legislation</li>
	<li>
		Large scale projects implementation (international cooperation) and history of importance between sustainability and economic means</li>

</ul></p>

<h3>Reactivating Educational Systems in Post-Disaster Situations</h3>
<p>Following natural hazards or political strife, the reactivation of shutdown education systems can be left undone for some time. This topic will focus on aiding countries that have recently undergone some sort of disaster, and thereafter focus on developing a long-term generalized plan to aid the reinstitution of shutdown education systems.</p>
<h3>Preserving Endangered Cultures and Languages</h3>
<p>Preserving the diversity of culture and languages in the world is one of UNESCO's major tasks. It is how we preserve the history and diversity of humanity. As time goes on and cultures are threatened or assimilated, it is UNESCO's job to preserve as well as document these cultures. This committee will focus on creating a comprehensive plan to that effect.</p>

<h3>Political Conflict in Cote d Ivoire</h3>
<p>	Among the functions of the United Nations Security Council, the preservation of international peace and security is at the forefront. In the past, the UNSC has taken specific actions towards this aim in countries experiencing political strife. Most recently, political conflict in C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire has sparked interest both with the UN and with a number of human rights groups.</p>

<p>
	In November 2010, run-off presidential election results, as determined by a third-party election commission, reported that Alassane Ouattara was the winner, ending incumbent Laurent Gbago&#39;s decades-long regime. When Mr. Gbago refused to cede power, citing results released by his administration that declared him the winner, a troubling dispute was sparked--and soon escalated to violence. By Feburary 2011, the United Nations warned that the violence had fully escalated to civil war. By April 2011, Ouattara supporters captured Gbago, ending the war, and leading to Ouattara&#39;s inaguration in May. Now as C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire seeks to reconcile its factions in the wake of civil war, it faces the great tasks of finding homes for some of the 500,000 people displaced, and of international investigations and proceedings to determine whether or not war crimes and crimes against humanity took place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire has experienced a history of political strife and civil war since its first military coup in 1999. Accordingly, there has been a timeline of UNSC intervention in C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire. Ethnic conflict, human rights abuses, crime networks, and high poverty rates are some of the many problems that, have in the past and, continue to threaten the political stability of C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire. Among the issues the UNSC must bear in mind is the balance between ensuring state soveriegnty while protecting against human rights infringement. <strong>It will be your job to determine the best means for the United Nations to return permanent political stability to C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire.</strong></p>
<h3>Children in Armed Conflict: Myanmar</h3>
<p>	While the nature of armed conflict has changed dramatically in recent decades, in many developing and underdeveloped nations, the involvement of children in armed conflict has intensified. More and more, children are being used as soldiers and, in the process, made the victims of terrorist acts, abduction, rape, and denial of myriad other basic human rights. The UNSC has taken a special interest in this issue in recent years, and while noteworthy progress has been made toward ending these violations against children, there is still much to do.</p>
<p>
	The situation in Myanmar is especially bleak. Long-time military rule by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), while nominally over, has led to the obscuration of passed child conscription laws as forcible recruitment of children has expanded with the Tatmadaw Kyi&#39;s (armed forces&#39;) need for greater troops to silence resistance to the nation&#39;s authoritarian rule. Children and teens are often taken from bus and train stations by appointed recruiters given quotas for enlistment and threatened into service. They are often then listed as 18-year-olds in official records despite their actual age. Enlistment of children even younger than those recruited by the government often occurs by splinter resistance groups like the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), and the Shan State Army (SSA). As a result, many children and families have fled Myanmar due to the outbreaks of conflict. The UNSC put the situation in Myanmar specifically on its agenda in 2007, and has conducted prelimiary research as to the scope of the issue, but has yet to order significant action. <strong>It will be your job to decide what the goals of the UNSC should be in preventing the further infringement of children&#39;s rights in Myanmar given the state of affairs, and how best to proceed with these goals in mind.</strong></p>

<h3>The Question of Famine and Agricultural Development in the Horn of Africa</h3>
<p>This question is particularly concerned with the recent famine in Somalia. Particular attention should be directed towards the causes and effects of the droughts that cause food shortages. Moreover, particular attention should be given to the recent phenomenon of desertification. Besides tackling the need for immediate food supplies and other forms of humanitarian aid, delegates should focus on the development of political, social, economic and particularly agricultural conditions in order to solve the problem in the long-term.</p>
<h3>The Question of Market Stabilization and Local Economy Stimulation in Asia</h3>
<p>This question is particularly concerned with the issues of inflation that aggravate many Asian countries especially in recent times. The resolution should focus on the development of long-term stable markets. The development of local--particularly rural--economies should be a major focus. Agriculture should be stimulated at a local level--most especially to take into consideration low-income farmers who are struggling due to competition with large firms.</p>

<h3>Childhood Hunger and Malnutrition in Developing Countries</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problems in developing countries is a lack of solid infrastructure, which leads to a deficiency in adequate levels of both food and water. As a result, the World Health Organization considers malnutrition the single greatest threat to the world's public health. Furthermore, in many countries where the median income is less than 1 U.S. dollar a day, hunger and malnutrition are huge national issues. This causes major health issues as the rate of transferable diseases rise, and infrastructure suffers as a result. As a committee, the WHO will work to focus on the health concerns caused by malnutrition and hunger, and specific ways to alleviate this in both developed and developing countries.</p>
<h3>Preventing the Spread of Communicable Diseases After A Natural Disaster</h3>
<p>The recent slew of natural disasters, from flooding in Pakistan to the earthquake in Haiti, have taken a very immense toll on a number of States. However, one oft-overlooked aspect of a natural disaster is the aftermath. The aftermath of a natural disaster often contributes significantly to the overall damage and death toll. One of the largest effects a disaster inflicts upon a country is making its conditions immensely unsanitary and utterly delapidated. This causes a spike in communicable diseases through both unsanitary water and air. These diseases are compounded by a poor health care system or, most generally, a health system that is either not large enough or not timely enough in responding, to provide the necessary care. As a committee, delegates will be working on ways to prepare health care facilities in countries prone to natural disaster in order to be prepared in the case of disaster, and work towards effective solutions to deal with disasters properly--that is, with the least amount of damage to the country or region possible.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
<p>In 1986, the World Trade Organization introduced a set of rules known as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS for short. This agreement was the first agreement to dive into the multilateral dimension of the trading world, attempting to narrow differences across countries and synthesize everything under a set of governing international rules. While goods and services constitute a main portion of trade across countries, ideas and knowledge are increasingly becoming facets of trade as well. For inventors, it can be argued that the most important assets they possess are their ideas and designs. In order for them protect those ideas, they are given the right to prevent others from using their ideas, as well as the right to negotiate payment if others do plan on using them. Intellectual property rights can take many forms: copyrights, author’s rights, trademarks, related rights, patents, etc. Most of the inherit value that comes in ideas lies in their design, concept, invention, and research. Because these values are not tangible, it is hard to keep track of their movement across borders and countries. Hence, the tension. Governments and nations hope to foster an environment in which creators will produce ideas that can benefit all people. However, different countries have their own respective rules in regards to intellectual property rights. Having intellectual property rights benefits society as it undoubtedly encourages creation. Therefore, it is up to the Word Trade Organization to intervene and set up rules, standards, and procedures that will fairly govern all countries.</p>
<h3>Anti-Dumping</h3>
<p>"Dumping" is, in essence, the practice of a company going into a new market (usually internationally) and selling its product below what would properly be considered the "fair" or market value of the product. This action can be damaging to the domestic and local markets as they are usually forced to either switch the products they produce and sell or go out of business, or try to compete, which is nearly impossible for a lot of local, non-international firms that cannot sustain themselves while selling below the more "fair" or market value of the product they were orginally selling. Many counties have anti-dumping laws that are stronger than any sort of agreements made under the GATT or by the WTO, but there are still many who have only made recommendations, as it is difficult to enforce any sort of legal action against companies (especially large and powerful international firms) who are underselling their competition. It will be your job to take another look at the current agreements, and, keeping your country's domestic economy and local firms in mind, come up with some new (perhaps stronger) agreements and resolutions on how to curtail the economically damaging act of dumping.</p>

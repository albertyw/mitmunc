<h1>2009 Committees</h1>

<h2>UNSC</h2>
<h3>Topic #1: The Situation In The Gaza Strip</h3>
<p>As of late January, the current situation in the Gaza Strip is that of a weak truce between combatants in Israel and the Gaza. The 22 day war has increased tensions in the region to the highest levels since Israel's 2006 invasion of Lebanon.  Given the UN and the West's interest in the region, how should the UN respond such that the Israeli-backed West and the Muslim community is happy with the outcome?  How can a lasting peace be made given current events?  </p>

<h2>UNDP</h2>
<h3>Topic #1: Reaffirming Commitment to Biotechnology in Attaining Food Security</h3>
<p>The global rise in food prices has been recognized as the largest hurdle in attaining Millenium Development Goal #1: Eradicating Hunger. While the promise of biotechnology in the form of genetically modified crops has been publicly recognized by the UNDP since 2001, it was met with opposition in some territories and has been unevenly advocated by the UNDP in its role as a national developmental partner.  How can we respond to the challenges and criticisms of GMOs, so that we can reaffirm, in good conscience, our commitment to supporting the development and implementation of genetically modified crops as part of hunger eradication?</p>
<h3>Topic #2: Scale Back of One Laptop Per Child</h3>
<p>The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project is an educational initiative meant to help school children in the developing parts of the world to access interactive learning by providing one connected laptop to every school-aged child. It started with MIT Professor Nicholas Negroponte's idea of bridging the technology divide between rich nations and the developing world by getting a $100 laptop into the hands of 150 million of the world's poorest school children.
The recent economic downturn in the US resulted in many OLPC staff being laid off.  While the UNDP has partnered with MIT in this initiative, perhaps the importance of the project and the present economic struggles suggest that it would be better shouldered by the broad network of the UNDP system. Is this a better solution? What challenges would arise from greater multistate involvement, and how can they be resolved?</p>

<h2>IAEA</h2>
<h3>Topic #1: Multi-lateralization of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Creation of an International Fuel Bank</h3>
<p>The internationalization of the nuclear fuel cycle was heavily discussed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially with regard to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Given the appropriate administrative authority, multinationalization and internationalization have the potential to improve the nuclear fuel cycle's resistance to proliferation. However, implementing such models would also have disadvantages, especially in the areas of political independence, transfer of technology, and planning security of national nuclear programs. With this in mind, should we pursue the multi-lateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle? What should the short- and long-term objectives of the UN's energy policy be?</p>
<h3>Topic #2: The Use of Nuclear Technology in the Achievement of the Millenium Development Goals</h3>
<p>The IAEA has undertaken a great effort in the application of technology and nuclear science to the achievement of the Millenium Development Goals. The technology the IAEA has contributed has been varied and vast in its application. One example of such a technology is Isotope Hydrology, a nuclear technique which helps measure the size, origin, flow and age of a particle water source, which in turn allows better planning and use of a water source. Going forward, how can we apply these sorts of technologies to further the achievement of the Development Goals? How can they be most effectively used, and what sort of cooperation among members of the international community will be required?</p>

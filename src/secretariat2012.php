Nikita Consul is a junior studying Chemical Engineering, Biology, and Writing. 
She has enjoyed her experiences through Model United Nations at MIT and continues to seek further experiences to learn about International Relations. 
Apart from Model UN, she keeps herself happy by performing with MIT's South Asian Fusion dance team Chamak, 
painting landscapes or abstract shapes on canvas, and trying new baking recipes. 
Her ambitions for the future include traveling the world, becoming a physician-scientist, and working closely with the government.

After participating in Model UN for three years in high school, I decided to continue with it at MIT. 
Not only has it matched up well with my major in Political Science (I will also have a major in Mathematics), but it has also given me great opportunities to
participate in exciting conferences, and plan exciting conferences like MITMUNC. 
After being the chair of the WTO last year, I will increase my efforts to make MITMUNC IV a success by being a secretary-general. 
I have learned a lot by attending a plethora of conferences last year, and will learn even more by being a Head Delegate for MIT's MUN team this year; 
I will be able to gather the best practices from a variety of conferences to improve MITMUNC. 
I look forward to working with you to make MITMUNC IV a huge success, and am eager to see all of you in February!

Hi, my name is Albert Wang and I will be your USG and CTO for MITMUNC 2012.  I am a senior studying computer science and electrical engineering 
while working on a computational biology research project in phylogenetics and 
this is my fourth year staffing MITMUNC.  In the past, I have been the chair (2011) and crisis director (2009) of the UNSC, Secretary-General (2010), 
and Charg&eacute; d'Affaires (2011).  I also coded the mitmunc.mit.edu website.  This year, as the Under-Secretary-General, I will be in charge of 
ensuring the committees are run smoothly.  If you have any committees or topics that you would like to see, or have any questions about 
preparing for committees, please email me.

Hi there! My name is Coyin and I will be the Charg&eacute;e Affaires for MITMUNC 2012. 
For those not familiar with the term Charg&eacute;e, this translates into: I will be the main point of contact between participating schools and the MITMUNC Secretariat. 
If you have any questions regarding registration or general logistics, feel free to email me. 
I started getting involved in Model UN since 2008, and serving as the USG in MITMUNC 2011 has definitely been a great experience for me to understand how MITMUNC runs. 
Some non-MUN facts: I am a sophomore from Malaysia majoring in computer science and molecular biology, so while I am not programming and writing codes that analyze 
antibody structures, I am likely to be found in the basement of Building 1 playing with fly larvae to get them to digest organic waste matter.

Eyas is a junior studying Computer Science. 
He is passionate about many things, including international relations, reconciliation, and coexistence. 
As such, Eyas was keen on getting the most out of his Model UN experiences in high school, and is also very excited about 
helping other students have similar experiences. Coming from Amman, Jordan in the Middle East, he feels strongly about peace, 
compromise, and negotiation. Eyas was involved in MITMUNC in 2009 and 2010, and is excited about helping out in his third year at MITMUNC! 
Loves horseback riding, reading, procrastination, writing software, and blogging, Eyas is an interesting fusion of.. interests. He looks forward to see you in MITMUNC IV!

Hi! I am originally from Taiwan, and attended an American school there from kindergarten until high school. 
That was where I did my three years of Model UN as the delegates of Panama, the Dominican Republic, and France. 
I'm now a sophomore at MIT, majoring in mathematics and potentially double majoring in architecture. 
On campus I am involved in a couple other activities such as Leadership Training Institute (of which I am also the Finance Director), The Tech, and Pi Beta Phi.

I am a sophomore at MIT majoring in math and biology and minoring in linguistics. 
After doing four years of Model UN in high school, I jumped right into Model UN at MIT and helped to co-chair the WHO at MITMUNC III. 
Aside from Model UN, my interests involve theater and dance, as a member of the MIT Shakespeare Ensemble, Dramashop, and Dancetroupe. 
I hope that an eventual career in computational biology and an appreciation and love for international relations will lead me well. 
I will be your Chief Operations Officer (COO), essentially handling the logistics of the conference and making sure everyone is situated nicely so that the 
conference can run smoothly and that everyone has an amazing time. I am excited for MITMUNC IV and hope to see you all in February.

Hey everyone! I'm a freshman at MIT thinking of majoring in Economics and
Management Science. In terms of MUN, I've had a very busy high school career as
I've had the amazing opportunity to attend 20 conferences throughout high
school. Last year, I lead the creation of Turkey's first all-French MUN
conference, the MFINUE, as its Secretary-General and am very excited to be
participating in MITMUNC IV as a member of the Secretariat. Before and during
the Conference, I'll be in charge of handling the PR and organizing our events,
so if you have any questions and/or suggestions regarding any of these, please
feel free to contact me at any time. Looking forward to an amazing conference!

<h1>January Update</h1>
<i>This email was sent out on January 13, 2011</i><br /><br />

<p>Dear MITMUNC Delegations' Faculty Advisers,</p>
<p>There are a few announcements that I would like to make for MITMUNC:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many schools have not yet made payment for MITMUNC registration fees.  
We really them them as soon as possible in order to have an accurate count of 
the number of delegates attending MITMUNC and we cannot assign schools their 
country assignments until payment has been made.  If you have made payment and 
we have not contacted you, please inform us.  If you will not be attending 
MITMUNC, please also inform us and we will remove you from this mailing list.  
</li>
<li>If you plan on staying overnight, please make reservations at the hotel 
TODAY if you haven't already.  MITMUNC delegations currently have a reduced 
rate at the Marriott hotel, which is very close to the conference building on 
MIT's campus.  After January 13, however, the rates will revert to their normal 
Marriott prices and rooms will not be guaranteed.  Information about the 
Marriott is available at <a href="http://www.mitmunc.org/accommodations">
http://www.mitmunc.org/accommodations.php</a></li>
<li>Delegates should be reminded that all of them will need to submit 
position papers by Sunday, January 30.  Position papers for all committees 
should be one page total (about half a page per topic) single spaced.  
Information about writing position papers is available at 
<a href="http://www.mitmunc.org/preparation">http://www.mitmunc.org/preparation.php</a>.</li>
<li>Since we are planning on serving refreshments to the delegates, please tell 
us as soon as possible if you, your fellow advisers, or delegates have any food 
allergies.  All delegates also need to submit a liability and medical form which
is found at http://www.mitmunc.org/mitmunc2011/liability2011.pdf.  Information about 
the position paper, liability/medical form, and other requirements is available 
at <a href="http://www.mitmunc.org/preparation">http://www.mitmunc.org/preparation.php</a>.</li>
<li>We're sorry that background guides have taken so long to be posted.  
We originally planned on having background guides posted shortly after 
Thanksgiving, but as MIT's finals were only two weeks afterwards, the chairs 
need extra time to finish background guides.  All the background guides except 
the CSTD committee's guide has been posted on the website on their respective 
pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at info at 
mitmunc.org</p>

With a double major in Political Science and American Studies, and a minor in History, Cory doesn't always find people with similar interests at such a tech-heavy school. Model UN, however, offers a great opportunity for him to share his passion for international relations with others. Returning this year as a Head Delegate for MIT's MUN team, Cory will have attended over a dozen conference by the year's end--using their best practices, Cory will help shape MITMUNC for the future. After chairing the WTO 2 years ago, and being a co-SG last year, he is thrilled to return as DSG of MITMUNC this year. He can't wait till February to make MITMUNC V a great success!</td>
